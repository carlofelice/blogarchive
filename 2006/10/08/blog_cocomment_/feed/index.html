		<description><![CDATA[Thailand is one of the most dynamically developing and exotic countries of Southeast Asia. The ancient exotics of the East and the latest advances of the modern world do coexist here: the Buddhist temples and tall skyscrapers, original culture and hectic night life, buoyant markets and huge malls, Thai cuisine and fashionable European restaurants.
The recent half-year saw increasing of the Thai social websites visitors&#039; amount in 10 times and it continues rising. They became really popular among the tourists visiting Thailand for a while and those who nearly &quot;live&quot; here. Most of them simply like online chatting. Some of them just want to improve their language, which means that they visit them for studying and for a progress in word-building and chatter.
There are no Thai original social websites. There are only some foreign ones having no representation in Thailand which beats their reputation very much and lowers interest for them. Yet there is the only website which includes in itself all advantages and possibilities – [B][URL=http://youngsiam.com]Thailand Dating Community - YoungSiam.com[/B][/URL].
What is the difference between Young Siam and plenty of other dating sites or sites of the same profile? It is at youngsiam.com that besides forum and chat you can have a short look at everything going on in Thailand, news, any kind of information on Thailand nightlife and its inhabitants and different events ads. It is information that finally forms appreciation from the very fact of being in that or any other place. As they speak, the more you know - the better you have rest. Isn&#039;t it the biggest dissimilarity of [URL=http://youngsiam.com]youngsiam.com[/URL] from the other contestants&#039;?
The main aim we pursue is not search of a helpmate but enjoying chatter, mood you create yourself. There are no complexes in online and you become free which in common with your personal qualities makes you and your interlocutor enjoy the chatter because you will anyway find someone with whom it will be interesting. For instance, the average Thai spends nearly half of his free time and this is significant.
The possibility of adding your own files and video makes [URL=http://youngsiam.com]youngsiam.com[/URL] be higher than other networks. Storing and editing your photos and video, exchanging music and one-reelers and simply keeping your photos there is possible. One of the features is that you can place your photos directly from your handset. It is very comfortable for those people who use their handsets as the internet device.
There are plenty of the sections with photos and the most popular of them is the &quot;beauties&quot; section. It is in this section that you can see the most beautiful girls of Thailand. Pretty different, beautiful, charming and fascinating [URL=http://youngsiam.com]Thailand girls[/URL] will look at you from your monitor. These photos can&#039;t be forgotten. Moreover, you can add your picture there and don&#039;t forget - a rating is being kept.
One more point to be set up is that all the services totally for free. You should not pay for opening your blog or for downloading the photos, no payments are contributed - everything is for free.  All the possibilities provided to the clients have no restrictions in volume, time or any other factor. This is yet one more difference from mercantile foreign websites working for their selves, not alike this.
The most interesting thing is that you can hold parties or meetings online where you can invite your Thailand friends. For instance, a party of champagne or martini, any topic you&#039;d prefer. in the invitation you can write that admittance in tuxedos and with photos in subject costume only. The invitations can be sent to your friends or the people whom you like with the rest banned. Such a party is being moderated by its founder. This stimulates companionship in a particular social stratum and creates a core which can be restored then in real life. You can sell the tickets on these parties yourself.
Website meetings are also being held in offline mode, in Bangkok clubs. Usually these are friends gathering together or haunters in amount of 50-100 people and have fun.
Besides everything described in above the website also allows you to create your own blog with the possibility of commenting it. Interior mail service allows you to send file of any format: music, photo, video, texts, etc.
Join and open a new life, create your own world which can&#039;t be built in real life is one of the main aims of the society in the network. Youngsiam.com offers very wide possibilities for spending your network life and joining the existing structure. We do hope that you will not only enjoy the socializing, teach the language and provide new acquaintances, but also will induce you to visit Thailand if you haven&#039;t been there before. We are glad to see you!

		<description><![CDATA[Buongiorno a tutti,
Scrivo a questo gruppo per informare che esiste un forum curato
dall&#039;agenzia investigativa AMICO (Svizzera) che si sta occupando della
ricerca di Erika Ansermin, che risiedeva ad Aosta amata ed apprezzata
da tutti.
La famiglia e&#039; nella piu&#039; completa disperazione dopo due anni dalla
scomparsa, ancor di piu&#039; ora che il padre di Erika e&#039; morto in seguito
ad una grave malattia sperando fino all&#039;ultimo di poter riabbracciare
la figlia.
Sensibilizzando la gente di Aosta credo sia possibile fare breccia in
quel muro di silenzio ed omerta&#039; che ancora avvolge il caso con
l&#039;intento di dare alle autorita&#039; che se ne occupavano (e si stanno
ancora occupando anche se non ufficialmente) indizi sufficienti per
poter scrivere la parola fine ed arrivare finalmente alla verita&#039; su
quello che e&#039; successo ad Erika.
Confido in voi, il link vi permettera&#039; di accedere al forum, e&#039;
sufficiente registravi anche in forma anonima e partecipare magari
dicendo cose di cui nessuno era al corrente prima.
Fate la vostra buona azione quotidiana.
Buona giornata a tutti
